# 👋 Hi, I'm Karen Silva!

**BI Strategist | F1 Data Storyteller | Consultant-in-the-Making | Bilingual 🇺🇸 🇧🇷**

I’m the kind of person who gets unreasonably excited when a messy dataset finally makes sense.
Give me chaos in CSV form — I’ll hand you back a dashboard with a storyline.

I’m obsessed with how data drives decisions — whether it’s helping a Formula 1 team shave milliseconds off a lap or helping a business stop guessing and start knowing.
My superpower? Turning numbers into narratives people actually care about.

Fueled by espresso shots, curiosity, and the holy trinity of Power BI | SQL | Python, I still find time to question life’s biggest metric: what’s the real KPI of happiness?

When I’m not knee-deep in queries or color palettes, you’ll probably find me:

🏎️ Analyzing race strategies like it’s a religion (because… it is).

🎨 Redesigning dashboards just because they could look sexier.

📊 Turning everyday chaos into data (yes, I once tracked how many times I said “just one more chart” — and no, it wasn’t once).

I believe good analysis doesn’t just inform, but it inspires.
So whether it’s racing, business, or life, I’m here to translate data into clarity: One insight at a time.
